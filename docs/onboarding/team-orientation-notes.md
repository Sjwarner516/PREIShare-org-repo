# PREIshare team orientation notes

Author: Sydni
Date: 2026-08-30

**Team repository of record (authoritative URL):**
https://github.com/EdTechForLearning/PREIShare-org-repo

**My fork (do not confuse with the team repo):**
https://github.com/Sjwarner516/PREIShare-org-repo
(GitHub shows “forked from EdTechForLearning/PREIShare-org-repo”.)

The team URL was cross-checked in Step 2 against the live GitHub page and the
GitHub API (`full_name`: `EdTechForLearning/PREIShare-org-repo`, default
branch `main`). The fork URL was confirmed from a signed-in GitHub screenshot
and the API (`fork: true`, parent = the team repo). If an earlier draft used a
different team address, the EdTechForLearning URL wins.

## 1. Product mission (my words)

PREIshare helps people make better real-estate decisions by turning property
and market data into clear intelligence. The engineering team ships that
product as a modern web app (TypeScript, TanStack Start, React, and related
data tools). My job as a new contributor is to join that shipping loop
safely—not to rewrite the product on day one.

## 2. Everyday collaboration → engineering workflow

| Everyday picture | PREIshare engineering parallel |
| --- | --- |
| Shared final document | Shared default branch on the team repository |
| My draft copy | My feature branch with a small change |
| Save history / version notes | Commits with clear messages |
| Ask a peer to review before publish | Open a pull request (PR) for review |
| Peer approves, then we publish | Review passes, then the PR can merge |

## 3. Actors in a pull-request workflow

- **Contributor (me):** picks a tiny safe change, works on a branch, describes the change, responds to feedback.
- **Reviewer (teammate or simulated reviewer):** checks correctness, scope, and clarity before merge.
- **Shared repository:** the team’s source of truth on GitHub
  (`EdTechForLearning/PREIShare-org-repo`); contributors do **not** push
  branches there directly. Work happens on a personal fork, then a PR
  targets the team repo.
- **Automation (later):** checks such as GitHub Actions may run on the PR; I treat failing checks as blockers, not noise.

## 4. First-PR definition of done (beginner-safe)

My first reviewed PR is done only when all of the following are true:

1. **Scoped:** The change is intentionally small (for example onboarding docs or a contributors list)—not a multi-feature rewrite.
2. **Isolated:** Work happened on a feature branch, not by editing the shared default branch directly.
3. **Described:** The PR states why the change exists, what files changed, and how a reviewer can verify it.
4. **Reviewable:** A teammate can understand the diff without a meeting; notes capture any decisions or follow-ups.
5. **Verified:** I re-read the diff myself and fixed obvious mistakes before asking for review.
6. **Aligned:** The change matches team conventions I will learn in later steps (repo map, AI rules, best practices).

## 5. Out of scope for the first PR

- Large refactors, dependency upgrades, or database schema changes
- Secrets, production credentials, or real customer data
- “While I was here” unrelated edits that enlarge review risk

## 6. How I will use AI on this team

I will prompt agents in small cycles: understand → plan → prompt → review → refine.
I will not paste secrets into agents. I will not accept agent output I cannot explain.
Orientation complete means I can tell a human what PREIshare is, who is in the
PR loop, and what “first PR done” means—before I configure tools or write code.
